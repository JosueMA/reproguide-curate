## How to contribute

The manuscript is written in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with the [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) R package. The source file is `manuscript/manuscript.Rmd` (knit to view resulting PDF.)

### References & Citations

References are in `references.bib`. We manage citations with a combination of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) R Studio add-in, and [Better Bib(La)Tex](https://github.com/crsh/citr#better-biblatex-integration). With these, citations are automatically formatted and added from Zotero to the `references.bib` file.
