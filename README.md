### References & Citations

References are in `references.bib`. We manage citations with a combination of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) R Studio add-in, and [Better Bib(La)Tex](https://github.com/crsh/citr#better-biblatex-integration). With these, citations are automatically formatted and added from Zotero to the `references.bib` file.
